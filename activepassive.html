      <h1>What is Passive and Active Investing?</h1>
      <p>
        Within the investing world, there are two main strategies: passive and
        active. Passive investing invovlves buying mutual funds or exchange
        traded funds (ETFs) that track an index such as the Standard & Poor's
        500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. There are others such as the
        Russell 3000 and Wilshire 5000 but the S&P 500 and Dow Jones are the two
        mostly used, with the S&P 500 as the benchmark since it represents about
        80% of the United States total stock market by market capitalization.
        Active investing, on the other hand, has a manager picking and choosing
        what to invest in. Passive investing involves buying a diversified bucket
        knowing you get both winners and losers whereas active investing involves
        trying to pick the winners from the bucket. According to the 
        <a href="https://executiveeducation.wharton.upenn.edu/thought-leadership/wharton-wealth-management-initiative/wmi-thought-leadership/active-vs-passive-investing-which-approach-offers-better-returns/" target="_blank">Wharton School of Business</a>
        , these are the advantages of both investing strategies:
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Advantages of Passive Investing</h2>
        <ul> 
          <li>Low Fees - There are no expenses needed to do analysis of securities</li>
          <li>Good Transparency - Since they follow an index, the securities held are known</li>
          <li>Tax efficiency - Index funds use a buy and hold strategy so there are very little capital gains</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        <h2>Advantages of Active Investing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Flexibility - Managers do not have to follow an index so can choose any security</li>
          <li>Hedging - Managers can use options and other strategies to limit losses</li>
          <li>Tax Management = Managers can tailor strategies according to investor tax profiles and offset gains from one security with losses from another</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Which Strategy To Use?</h2>
      <p>
        Which strategy is best? The data says a diversified index fund is the best option. Index funds consistently beat their active counterparts. <a href=https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/27/new-report-finds-almost-80percent-of-active-fund-managers-are-falling-behind.html""> According to an article by Josh Meyers at CNBC.com</a>, as of March 2022, S&P 500 index funds have beaten their actively managed large cap counterparts for 12 consecutive years. 
        <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/research-insights/spiva/" target="_blank">The SPIVA (S&P indices vs Active) scorecard</a> indicates that only 15% of actively managed large cap fund has beaten the S&P 500 index over a 5 year period and only 10% over a 15 year period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Warren Buffet recommends investing in the S&P 500. He famously made a bet that a group of hedge funds would not beat the S&P 500 over a 10 year period. For the 10 year period ending in 2020, the S&P 500 won every year.

        There are some cases where an actively managed fund may make sense such as in emerging markets where data is more difficult to obtain. There is strategy that blends passive and active investing called <a href="factors.html">Factor Investing</a>.
