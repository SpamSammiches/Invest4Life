        <h1>What is Factor Investing?</h1>
        <p>
          Factor investing is an investing strategy that uses quantifiable
          criteria to explain returns on investments. The two main types of
          factors are macroeconomic factors which explain the broad market and
          style factors which help to explain returns within asset classes.
          Macroeconomic factors would include interest and unemployment rates.
          Style factors would include size, value, volatility, quality, and
          momentum. Style factors are the factors investment funds concentrate
          on.
        </p>

      <div class="center">
        <h2>The 5 Style Factors</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Size - Size deals with market capitalization of a company</li>
          <li>
            Value - The value factor is concerned with the price of a stock in
            relation to its fundamental value. Ratios such as price to book,
            price to earnings, or price to enterprise value are used.
          </li>
          <li>
            Momentum - Momentum looks at the price movement of an equity. Stocks
            prices that trend up tend to stay moving up and vice versa.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quality - Quaity looks at a company's quantitative financial metrics
            in addition to qualitative metrics such as good management.
          </li>

          <li>
            volatility - Stocks that have less volatility, as measured by
            standard deviation, in their price are believed to offer better
            returns.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Fama-French Three-Factor Model</h2>
        <p>
          In the 1990s, economists Eugene Fama and Kenneth French released a
          paper that indicated that size and value explained a statistically
          significant portion of market returns. Along with size and value, Fama
          and French used excess market returns due to market risk as the third
          factor. According to Fama and French, there is a premium associated
          with smaller size companies and more value oriented companies.
        </p>
        <h2>Small Cap Value vs S & P 500</h2>

        <p>
          According to data from Dimensional Fund Advisors , small cap value has
          outperformed the S&P 500 in every 20-year period from 1930-2019.

        </figure>
        <p>
          So why not put everything into small cap value? The extra premium
          comes with extra risk. Although small cap value has historically
          outperformed, there have been long periods where it has underperformed
          by almost 20 years.
