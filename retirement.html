        <h1>Two Main Types of Retirement Accounts</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>401k</li>
          <li>IRA</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The two main retirement accounts people will have access to are the
          401(k) and the Individual Retirement Account or IRA for short. These
          are other retirement accounts like the 403(b) but those are used by
          fewer people so we will no go into those.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="401k" class="b-rad center">
        <h1>401(k)</h1>
        <h3>What is a 401(k)?</h3>
        <p>
          A 401(k) is a savings plan offered by employers that employees can
          contribute to for their retirement. Employers typically will provide a
          matching contribution equal to some defined amount which is usually a
          percentage of pay.
        </p>
        <h3>Facts about a 401(k)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For the year 2022, an employee can contribute up to $20500. An
            employee age 50 and over can contribute an additional $6500 for a
            total of $27000.
          </li>
          <li>
            Offers different tax benefits depending on the type: Traditional and
            Roth
            <ul>
              <li>
                Traditional: Contributions are not taxed when they are made
                thereby reducing taxable income. Contributions and any gains are
                taxed when they are withdrawn.
              </li>
              <li>
                Roth: Contributions have been taxed when they are made. Any
                wthdrawals, including any gains, are therefore tax free.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Withdrawals before age 59.5 incur a 10% penalty.</li>
