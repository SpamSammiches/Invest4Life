        <h1>Two Main Types of Retirement Accounts</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>401k </li>
            <li>IRA</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The two main retirement accounts people will have access to are the 401(k) and the Individual Retirement Account or IRA for short. These are other retirement accounts like the 403(b) but those are used by fewer people so we will no go into those.

      <h1>401(k)</h1>
      <h3>What is a 401(k)?</h3>
      <p>
        A 401(k) is a savings plan offered by employers that employees can contribute to for their retirement. Employers typically will provide a matching contribution equal to some defined amount which is usually a percentage of pay.

      <ul>
        <li>For the year 2022, an employee can contribute up to $20500. An employee age 50 and over can contribute an additional $6500 for a total of $27000.</li>
        <li>Offers different tax benefits depending on the type: Traditional and Roth</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Traditional: Contributions are not taxed when they are made thereby reducing taxable income. Contributions and any gains are taxed when they are withdrawn.</li>
            <li>Roth: Contributions have been taxed when they are made. Any wthdrawals, including any gains, are therefore tax free. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Withdrawals before age 59.5 incur a 10% penalty.</li>
      </ul>
